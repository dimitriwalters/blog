I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I started this blog mainly to give advice - I already have a diary for random thoughts - and partly to force myself to come up with something to write about or finish thinking about my thoughts fully. Just a disclaimer - I'm only 22, but I'm a huge perfectionist and over-analyze mistakes I make throughout the day or some other time in my life. I'm an INTJ too if that helps. And if that wasn't enough information, you can always [email](mailto:me@dimi.io) me too!
